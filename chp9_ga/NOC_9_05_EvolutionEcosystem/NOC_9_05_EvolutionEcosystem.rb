# Evolution EcoSystem
# The Nature of Code

# A World of creatures that eat food
# The more they eat, the longer they survive
# The longer they survive, the more likely they are to reproduce
# The bigger they are, the easier it is to land on food
# The bigger they are, the slower they are to find food
# When the creatures die, food is left behind
