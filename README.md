#The-Nature-of-Code-Examples

A ruby port of the examples from [The Nature of Code][] by Daniel Shiffman.


Although many of the sketches here stand on their own merit, you should remember that they were originally designed to illustrate the book (so to get the most from them you should definetly [get the book][]). Since the sketches have been translated to a more idiomatic ruby, some of the sketches may not exactly match the points made in the book. However such sketches do serve to demonstrate the differences between processing and ruby-processing.
